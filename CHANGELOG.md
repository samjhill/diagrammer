## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-20

### 🚀 Major Release: Architectural Intelligence & Enhanced Relationships

This major release introduces sophisticated architectural analysis capabilities that match enterprise-grade documentation quality, inspired by the [Mindcraft project's architecture documentation](https://github.com/samjhill/mindcraft/blob/develop/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### ✨ New Features

#### 🧠 Architectural Intelligence
- **Framework Detection**: Automatically detects React, Vue, Angular, Express, Django, Flask, and more
- **Layer Classification**: Identifies frontend, backend, data, and infrastructure layers
- **Pattern Recognition**: Recognizes MVC, microservices, event-driven, and layered patterns
- **Responsibility Inference**: Analyzes component responsibilities (UI rendering, API communication, data access)

#### 🔗 Enhanced Relationship Detection
- **API Call Analysis**: Detects API endpoints, HTTP methods, and service communication
- **Event Flow Analysis**: Identifies event emissions, subscriptions, and event-driven patterns
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Tracks data flow through props, state, and database operations
- **Service Communication**: Maps service-to-service method calls and dependencies

#### 📊 New Diagram Types (10 Total)
1. **Architecture Overview** - Enhanced with architectural intelligence
2. **Layered Architecture** - Components organized by architectural layers
3. **API Flow** - API relationship analysis with endpoints and methods
4. **Data Flow** - Data flow between components with state and props
5. **Event Flow** - Event emission and subscription relationships
6. **Service Communication** - Service-to-service method calls
7. **Dependency Graph** - Enhanced with labeled arrows and classification
8. **Module Structure** - Enhanced with language tags and exports
9. **MVC Pattern** - Model-View-Controller pattern recognition
10. **Microservices Pattern** - Microservices architecture detection

#### 🌐 Multi-Language Support
- **Python Support**: Full Python code analysis with class, function, and import detection
- **Enhanced JavaScript/TypeScript**: Improved parsing and relationship detection
- **Language Tagging**: All components and modules tagged with their language

#### 🎨 Rich Visualizations
- **Color-Coded Components**: Different colors for different architectural roles
- **Labeled Relationships**: Arrows with descriptive labels (`-->|imports|`, `-->|emits|`, `-->|data|`)
- **Professional Styling**: Enterprise-grade visual design with proper class definitions
- **Sophisticated Grouping**: Components grouped by architectural layers and patterns

### 🔧 Improvements

#### Code Quality
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100+ test cases covering all new features
- **ESLint Compliance**: All code passes strict linting rules
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript support and type checking
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and graceful degradation

#### Performance
- **Optimized Analysis**: Efficient parsing and relationship detection
- **Caching**: Smart caching for improved performance
- **Memory Management**: Optimized memory usage for large codebases

#### Documentation
- **Enhanced README**: Beautiful Mermaid examples and comprehensive feature list
- **API Documentation**: Detailed documentation for all new analyzers
- **Examples**: Rich examples showing all diagram types
- **Configuration Guide**: Complete configuration options documentation

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed Mermaid syntax errors in diagram generation
- Resolved dependency version mismatches
- Fixed ESLint warnings and unused variable issues
- Corrected Python analyzer import detection logic
- Fixed relationship detection edge cases

### 📈 Technical Details

#### New Analyzers
- `ArchitecturalAnalyzer`: Framework detection, layer classification, pattern recognition
- `RelationshipAnalyzer`: API calls, event flows, data flows, service communication
- `PythonAnalyzer`: Complete Python code analysis support

#### Enhanced Generators
- `DiagramGenerator`: 10 sophisticated diagram types with rich styling
- Enhanced Mermaid generation with proper class definitions
- Sophisticated relationship visualization with labeled arrows

#### Configuration
- New `.diagrammer.yml` configuration options
- Enhanced language support configuration
- Improved filtering and analysis options

### 🎯 Impact

This release transforms Diagrammer from a basic diagram generator into a sophisticated architectural analysis tool that:

- **Matches Enterprise Quality**: Diagrams now rival professional architecture documentation
- **Provides Deep Insights**: Rich relationship analysis reveals system architecture
- **Supports Modern Development**: Multi-language support for diverse tech stacks
- **Enables Better Understanding**: Visual representations that actually help developers

### 🔄 Migration

No breaking changes - existing configurations continue to work. New features are opt-in through configuration.
