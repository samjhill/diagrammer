# Architecture Diagram Generator - Product Specification

## Overview

A GitHub Actions integration that automatically generates, maintains, and updates software architecture diagrams from code repositories. Inspired by the [Mindcraft project's architecture documentation](https://github.com/samjhill/mindcraft/blob/develop/ARCHITECTURE.md), this free tool transforms complex codebases into clear, professional architecture documentation directly within GitHub workflows, with a clear path to future monetization through premium features.

## Problem Statement
